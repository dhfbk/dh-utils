Hello
Hi
See you tomorrow
See you soon
Talking with you was a waste of time
I hope we will never meet again
I would like to have more opportunities to share the cultures
Thank you
I hope we will meet again
It was interesting talking to you
It wasn't nice to talk to you
Where are you from?
How are you?
You?
Where?
What?
Why?
What are you doing!?
What are you saying!?
Where is the problem?
What are looking for here? Come back to your country
Do you really think that I will do it?
Yes
Fine
Ok
Doesn't matter
Absolutely no!
You are right
I don't feel well
No
I don't know
I couldn't care less
I don't care
Me too
I am sorry
Go back to your country!
I don't like your behaviour
I am from Italy
I am from Asia
I am from Africa
You disgust me
I made a mistake
I don't want to mix the cultures
I don't want to continue this conversation
Do you have any problems to approach girls from this country?
Why do we have to stay with them?
I don't want to stay with them
A girl will never find a husband wearing like that!
I want to be only with people from my region
I prefer to spend time with Italians
I like that everyone can express their opinion
Can you give me your mobile phone?
Would you like to drink a coffe with me?
Despite the veil, your women are more depraved
I always have problems to communicate with European women!
We usually meet our wife for the first time during the weeding
I don't tolerate that the women have to wear the veil
My friends' experiences with women ended very badly
I have never had any interactions with Italian girl
I really appreciate that you're trying to integrate our communities
European women have more freedom
For me, there aren't any differences between Christian and Muslim girls
We use to marry our cousine
Marriages are usually forced by our parents
I don't think that our culture would ever find a compromise
I don't understand why women should work
The girls in this country don't demonstrate respect for the men
I just want to be accepted
The girls should at least cover the hair
I don't want a girlfriend from this country
I wish there was no more prejudice
Would you like to have a coffee with me?
I prefer some tea
I would like to have a coffee with you
You were late! You don't have any respect for me
What do you think about this situation?
How could it be possible that they have this behaviour!?
What do you think about policians?
Do you think that this is correct?
Do you think that this is normal?
Would you like to have more mosques?
They cause only crime!
I wish they could find a job easily!
Italians receive their houses for free!
The immigrants can only ruin my country!
The Italians don't understand our situation
I would like to increase the video surveillance
The police has to send them back to their country
Building more mosques means more terrorism
This is the only way to avoid that immigrants to steal our work!
The immigrants are invading my country
I would like to find a way to integrate immigrants in our country
Shut up! You get money from my country but I don't have any money for myself!
This idea is awesome
Politicians are behaving very badly!
Police forces are doing their work at least
All immigrants should be thrown out of the country
They should do this more frequently
My country is paying enough money to support the immigrants
I think some people are very ignorant
The police forces are careless
I would like to see more mosques built here
It is necessary to build more reception centres to help those people
Respect the rules
These rules do not make any sense
Of you mess it, clean it
Nobody respect the rules here
You are not my boss
This is not my home
I do not understand how to do it
You do not respect me
Clean up here
It is not my duty
If everyone respect the rules there wouldn't be any problems
In my country, you can't do that
You must wait in the queue
I will nevere become an Italian citizen
You will never have the right to become an Italian citizen
You stole!
You behave in this way only because I am a migrants
I skip the queue
I call the police
That is useless
The bureaucracy is a problem

Muslim women do not understand anything
Despite the veil, your women are more depraved
I always have problems to communicate with European women!
I don't tolerate that the women have to wear the veil
My friends' experiences with women ended very badly
In this way women respect their faith
Respect my culture, as I respect yours
You do not understand: that's our culture
I have never had any interactions with Italian girl
I really appreciate that you're trying to integrate our communities
European women have more freedom
For me, there aren't any differences between Christian and Muslim girls
I don't think that our culture would ever find a compromise
I don't understand why women should work
The girls in this country don't demonstrate respect for the men
The girls should at least cover the hair
I don't want a girlfriend from this country
I wish there was no more prejudice
I go for a walk
I am sure that this is migrants fault!
I just want to be accepted
You have no respect for my city
Italians have many prejudices
I will put the banana peel in this trash, altought it's not my fault
I respect your city and I would like to be accepted
Italians always think that the migrants are the guilties!
It's not my fault
Come back to your country
It's your fault!
The migrants dirty my city!
The girl close to me put the banana peel on the ground
Why do you have to think that it is my fault?
Someone throwed the trash on the ground
Hi, could you please…
No, I don't talk with you
Thanks a lot for your help
You are too stupid
You don't understand: I just want to know the directions for the station!
Go straight till the end of this street, then turn left!
I can show you the right way
I can come with you
Go away!
I am lost
Why are you disturbing me?
I would like to know the directions for the train station
Could you help me?
Stop begging for money
Look, i am not asking for money
Give me the bike's documents
I am tired to be considered a thief
The police has stopped me 10 times already
There are other people with the bike, why did you stop me?
Why are you blaming me?
You stole this bike!
Why do you think so?
You are a thief!
You, migrants, have to stop to steal
That bike is very nice!
I can show you the receipt!
This is my bike
I did not steal the bike!
I am going for a bike ride!
