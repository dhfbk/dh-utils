# ExtractExamples
For each tag, give a list of examples that can be used to understand whether the tag can be mapped to another one.
Lines having a tag start with ###: in these lines, one can add a tab and another tag that will result in a mapping
for the ExtractForStanford script.

# ExtractForStanford
Create train and test dataset using the example file for mapping.
